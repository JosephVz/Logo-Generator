# <Logo-Generator>>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

My motivation was to test my skills with something I believe i understand fairly decently. Through working on this project I was able to realize my position on where my knowledge sits on this subject and what i can do with this knowledge and what i can create.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

I built this project to further my knowledge on using the built in terminal. The README generator helped my knowledge in this area although this project had even furthered this knowledge to really show the use of these features.

- What problem does it solve?

This solves the problem of someone who doesnt know how to make a logo, although the project is extremely simple it can still take a basic shape and text to make a mock logo, possibly to use for development stages.

- What did you learn?

I learned how to create tests for the code i write and the usefullness of this feature in the real world. I also learned on how to use different dependencies within the project im working on, in this case it would be generating a logo based on user inputs.
